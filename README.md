# Exiled-IOS

## Description
Exiled is a simple proof of concept game where you need to survive several turns. 
Each turn you have the ability to upgrade your kingdom with the gathered resources.

### Events
Events is one of the main features of Exiled, each turn an event will be selected out of the discoverd event pool.
This event will have consequences on your kingdom but not only that each event has choices linked to it to further increase your freedom in controlling your kingdom.
An event can also have successors attached to it, because of this maps can be created which can contain an multitude of stories.
